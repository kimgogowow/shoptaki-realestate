        <h1>About our Program</h1>

        Our system incorporates an acquisition model to calculate the important financial metrics based on the following
        property details: price, cap rate, loan to value, interest rate, and years of amortization.
        <br> <br>
        The output is separated into two scenarios: interest only and principal & interest. Both scenarios result in
        outputs for principal, interest, free cash flow, cash on cash, debt yield, and debt constant. These metrics are
        important for determining the potential profitability and return on investment for the property.
        <br> <br>
        To give you a better idea of how your investment will perform in the first year, we also provide a mortgage
        calculator result. This showcases how your principal and interest payments will change over the course of a year
        if you decide to invest in this property.
        <br> <br>
        Our website offers a platform for users to search for and analyze property investments. Users can access their
        profile page to view personal information and projects, and use our acquisition model to calculate important
        financial metrics based on inputs such as price, cap rate, loan to value, interest rate, and years of
        amortization. Our website also provides a mortgage calculator to showcase how principal and interest payments
        will change over the first year of investment.
